Project: Personal Expense Tracker

Scenario

You're building a simple command-line expense tracker that helps users manage their daily expenses. 
The system should allow users to record expenses, categorize them, view summaries, 
and persist data to a CSV file so information isn't lost between sessions.

Requirements

Core Functionality

Add Expense: Users should be able to add a new expense with:
Description (string)
Amount (float/int)
Category (string: food, transport, entertainment, utilities, other)
Date (string in YYYY-MM-DD format)
Is recurring? (boolean)


View All Expenses: Display all recorded expenses in a readable format

View Expenses by Category: Filter and show expenses for a specific category

Calculate Total Spending:

Total across all categories
Total per category
Total for recurring vs. one-time expenses


Find Expense: Search for expenses by description (partial match allowed)

Remove Expense: Delete an expense by its index/ID

Data Persistence:

Save all expenses to a CSV file when exiting
Load expenses from CSV file when starting the program

Budget Warning: Set a monthly budget limit and warn users if they exceed it

Technical Requirements

Data Types to Use:

int/float: Expense amounts, calculations, indexing
str: Descriptions, categories, dates, user input
bool: Recurring flag, validation checks, menu loops
list: Store all expenses, store valid categories
tuple: Store individual expense data (immutable record)
set: Track unique categories used, check for duplicates
dict: Store expense as key-value pairs (alternative to tuple), category-wise summaries

Control Flow:

if/elif/else: Menu selection, input validation, budget checking, category filtering
for loops: Iterating through expenses, calculating totals, displaying data
while loops: Main program loop, input validation loops

CSV Operations:

Read expenses from CSV on startup
Write expenses to CSV on exit or after each addition
Handle missing file on first run

SOLID Principles to Apply:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Separate functions for different tasks (adding expense, calculating total, saving to CSV, etc.)
Each function should do ONE thing well

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Design functions to easily add new categories without modifying existing code
Use data structures that make extension easy

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

If you create variations of expense types, they should work interchangeably

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

Create focused functions that don't force unnecessary parameters
Keep function interfaces clean and minimal

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level operations (like "generate report") shouldn't depend on low-level details (like CSV format)
Use abstraction where possible


Bonus Challenges

Add date range filtering (expenses between two dates)
Export summary report to a separate text file
Handle invalid CSV data gracefully
Add expense editing functionality
Calculate average daily/weekly spending

Learning Goals
This project will help you practice:

Working with multiple data types in realistic scenarios
Understanding when to use lists vs tuples vs sets vs dicts
Writing clean, modular functions (SRP)
Input validation and error handling
File I/O with CSV module
Building a complete program with a menu-driven interface

Start by planning your data structures and function signatures before writing code!
